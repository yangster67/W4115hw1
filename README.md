# Force_pp Fall 2024 W4115hw1

### Team:
Kevin Yang; ky2488
Dale Yu; dy2446

## Installation Steps
Needs GCC installed to compile in c++17.

To run tests on Linux/Mac:
./run_tests.sh

To build and lex any file:
1. make main
2. ./main file_name 


# Homework 1 Components
The main files for this part of the homework can be found in `/lexer/lexer.cpp` `/token/token.h` and `/test/lexer_test.cpp`
## Language Components
KEYWORD = while | if | else | for | forn | 
TYPE = int | vector | ll | pair | 
SYMBOL = ( | ) | { | } | ;
OPERATOR = + | - | / | * | = | ==
NUMBER = [0-9]+
IDENTIFIER = [a-z][a-z|0-9]*

#### DFA 
We have the DFA rendered using graphviz and it is in the `/DFA`

*How to create the DFA*
- run the command `dot -Tpng dfa.gv -o dfa.png` 
Here is our DFA that our lexing algorithm is built on:
![DFA picture](/DFA/dfa.png)

This is like the basic structure of the DFA with some additions that we used to come up with our lexing algorithm that is in `/lexer/lexer.cpp`
- We basically check what character we are at and then test the different cases for what it is. If it is an accept state like the operators, then it is just that for the scanning algorithm. Otherwise it will keep trying to read digits or characters to make it an identifier or number.

  
## Lexing Algorithm
Most of the time, the symbol type can be deduced from the first character, so it looks at that first and then does maximal munch to see how much we can take per word. 

## Shell Testing Scripts
testing scripts are found in `/tests`
